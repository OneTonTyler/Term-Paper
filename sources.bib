title = {Governance of the World's Mineral Resources: Beyond the Foreseeable Future},
year = {2021},
abstract = {Governance of the World's Mineral Resources: Beyond the Foreseeable Future provides in-depth information on the geological scarcity of mineral resources. The book demonstrates the urgent need to implement sustainable utilization of mineral resources, in order to ensure that these resources will be sufficiently available for future generations too. The availability of resources, especially for modern technologies, is an increasingly important issue. Some key mineral resources are so geologically scarce that their availability for future generations may not only become substantially less, but also much less affordable than for the current generation unless timely measures are taken. This book provides detailed data and calculations of the availability of mineral resources. The book elaborates on whether and how it is possible to keep providing sufficient mineral resources to a growing world population, and for how long. The book details also how and for how much time it will be possible for all countries, worldwide, to achieve and maintain service delivery of raw materials to their population at levels equivalent to those in developed countries in 2020. Governance of the World's Mineral Resources: Beyond the Foreseeable Future is therefore an important source of knowledge for postgraduates, academics and researchers in the fields of environmental science, sustainability, and geology, as well as anyone in the field of mining and economics who need to account for sustainable provision of mineral resources.},

volume = {6},
year = {2017},
abstract = {Mining industries provide most of the materials we rely on to build infrastructures and instruments of daily use, to obtain large amounts of energy, and to supply agriculture with fertilizers that enable most of foods produced. At the same time, mining is the human activity that has been more disturbing to environment and is linked to large social impacts and inequalities. Notwithstanding, our future is deeply depending on mining. Several mining sectors, from phosphate to uranium, are reviewed and their current impacts and challenges are discussed. The mining legacy and environmental remediation, the present mining and challenges, and the future mining and society are discussed in relationship with environmental health and sustainable development. It is concluded that current mining practices need to change and contribute to community development with more equity, and to protect better natural resources and ecosystems in order to be environmentally acceptable and compliant with sustainable development objectives.

abstract = "{The wide dissemination of sustainable development in international law has generated considerable academic interest. However, because of the evasive and flexible content of what has been termed by the ICJ a concept in the Gabcˇíkovo-Nagymaros case, and more recently an objective in the Pulp Mills case, academic commentary has often struggled to ascertain sustainable development’s legal nature, which has proved a notion defying legal classification. One attractive thesis has been Lowe’s analysis of sustainable development as an interstitial or modifying norm which exerts its normative influence as an interpretative tool in the hands of judges. Its interpretative function is certainly very significant. Judicial bodies have used it to legitimize recourse to evolutive treaty interpretation, as a rule of conflict resolution, and even to redefine conventional obligations. However, beyond this convenient hermeneutical function, by laying down an objective to strive for in hundreds of treaties, sustainable development primarily purports to regulate state conduct. As an objective, it lays down not an absolute but a relative obligation to achieve sustainable development. Such obligations are known as obligations of means or of best efforts. Legal subjects are thus ultimately under an obligation to promote sustainable development.}",
