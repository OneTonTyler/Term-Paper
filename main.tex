\section{Background}

 Here is some very long text to check the spacing. There is no information here, so please stop reading now. I really shouldn't have to tell you this, but since you are still reading this sentence, I suppose you must be the dumbest person alive. There is literally nothing of value in this text block. Do I really need to spell it out for you at this point? \\

T-H-E-R-E I-S N-O-T-H-I-N-G O-F V-A-L-U-E H-E-R-E-.
